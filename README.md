# Voting System Simulator
The Voting System Simulator is intended to simulate various methods of voting and counting those votes in order to determine which one(s) best represent the collective will of voters.


Current voting systems added:
Plurality - the election format that the United States uses for its presidential elections.


Voting systems to be implemented:
Ranked Choice - Also known as instant-runoff voting, it allows voters to indicate relative preferences and makes more votes meaningful
Copeland-Borda - Voters rank the candidates, who are assigned points based on these rankings; relative rankings on ballots are used as tiebreakers
